# Daily-Message-Board
My program uses TCP, allows the client to connect to the server and send a message which is stored
in specific directories and files and can be viewed on the message board.

### Execution
You will need to change the filepath variable in the Server java file to match that of the file path you would like.


This can be run by opening two terminals: The Server (will be referred to as A) and The Client (will be referred to as B).


Enter the ssh command into terminal A, then change directories into the src folder found inside the
practical folder.


In terminal B, change directories into the same src folder.


In terminal A, run the server class titled TcpServerSimpleNB.


In terminal B, run the client class class titled TcpClientSimpleNB.


From here you can enter in any message you would like (within the 256 character limit) and it shall be seen on the message board.
